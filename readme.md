### Project description

This R project consists in the datasets used for the production of the analyses and plots exposed in the article. Time to event analysis applied to seedling emergence and survival data of *Pinus halepensis* experiments, as an invasive species in Sierra de la Ventana mountains in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.

* Folder */data*. Datasets in CSV format: seedling emergence and survival, vegetation, precipitation. 
* Folder */R*. R scripts for replicating the analyses and plots of the article. They are supposed to be run within the Rproject environment (relative path indicated).
* Folder */fig*. Figures output in pdf format.
